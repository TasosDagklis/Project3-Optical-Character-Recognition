# Project3-Optical-Character-Recognition
OCR Classification
Classification for the Optical Character Recognition problem. Creating a system that takes images as input and returns an estimate of the character that each depicts.
The version of the problem is simplified. For each character there was a procedure of isolation from the rest of the image and extracting certain invariant features,
using techniques from the field of image processing. In particular, the features are certain statistics of the spatial distribution of the pixels.
